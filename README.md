This is an assignment for SAE Institute that required us to make a drawing using HTML and CSS excluding the use of <img> tags. I took this as an oppurtunity to create an educational site about queer identities and flags, all manually drawn in a canvas.

Feel free to do whatever you want with this code, but if you are going to use this code in one of your public projects, then credit would be appreciated.
