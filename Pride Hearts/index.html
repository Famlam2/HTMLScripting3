    <div id = "rainbow">
        <h1>LGBTQ+ (Queer)</h1>
        <p>Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, Queer, and more. This refers to a community of people who fall outside the societal expectations for sexual and romantic orientation and gender identity.</p>
        <p>Queer people have a long history of discrimination and misunderstanding that still continues to this day, with many African and middle eastern countries still incorporating a death sentence for those who identify with the community.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id = "lesbian">
        <h1>Lesbian</h1>
        <p>Someone who is (usually) feminine presenting that is attracted to feminine presenting people.</p>
        <p>People who are not feminine presenting may still identify as lesbian due to specific, personal reasons and circumstance, such as identification with enby gender identities.</p>
        <p>Lesbians have a lack of discrimination compared to other queer identities, due to and at the cost of the male gaze and the sexualisation of sapphic relationships.</p>
    </div>
    <div id = "gay">
        <h1>Gay</h1>
        <p>Someone who is (usually) masculine presenting that is attracted to masculine presenting people.</p>
        <p>People who are not masculine presenting may still identify as gay due to specific, personal reasons and circumstance, such as identification with enby gender identities.</p>
        <p>Gays are more widely accepted than most queer identities due to a cultural shift that occurred over the past 50 years, however gay people have historically been heavily discriminated against and much of that discrimination remains.</p>
    </div>
    <div id = "bi">
        <h1>Bisexual</h1>
        <p>Someone who is attracted to masculine, feminine, and non-binary presenting people.</p>
        <p>Bisexual people are usually attracted to specific traits of different genders.</p>
        <p>Bisexual people experience a misunderstanding of how one can be bi that often comes from within the community itself, which can lead to discrimination. Many bi people are told to "pick a side", but it is not that simple.</p>
    </div>
    <div id = "pan">
        <h1>Pansexual</h1>
        <p>Someone who is attracted to everyone, regardless of gender.</p>
        <p>Pansexual people do not usually care for specific gendered traits, but rather are attracted to the people themselves.</p>
        <p>Pansexual people experience a misunderstanding of their identity and are often lumped together with bisexual people, even though their attractions are experienced differently.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id = "trans">
        <h1>Transgender</h1>
        <p>Someone who identifies as a gender that does not correlate with their biological sex.</p>
        <p>Trans people experience a type of dysphoria towards their sex that can be overcome by socially transitioning and then receiving gender-affirming care such as HRT.</p>
        <p>Trans people are at a higher risk of discrimination than most queer people due to their physical presentation and scapegoating from right wing politicians.</p>
    </div>
    <div id = "enby">
        <h1>Non-binary (NB/enby)</h1>
        <p>Someone who identifies with a gender that falls outside the binary of masculine or feminine, but not necessarily excluding either.</p>
        <p>Some enby people may feel dysphoria towards their body, whereas others are more apathetic. Most enby people will present themselves ambiguously, but not all do. Some have a fluid gender, that can change from day to day. It's a very broad spectrum.</p>
        <p>Enby people are at a higher risk of discrimination than most queer people due to their physical presentation and scapegoating from right wing politicians.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id = "ace">
        <h1>Asexual</h1>
        <p>Someone who experiences a lack of sexual attraction that is unrelated to libido.</p>
        <p>This may manifest through sex-repulsion, where the individual is repulsed by the idea of sex, however many asexuals do have sex despite the fact that they do not feel the need to seek it out. Some asexuals are attracted to the idea of sex, but do not wish to experience it themselves.</p>
        <p>Asexual people are often viewed as "unnatural" and "weird", which results in indirect (and sometimes direct) discrimination.</p>
    </div>
    <div id = "aro">
        <h1>Aromantic</h1>
        <p>Someone who experiences a lack of romantic attraction.</p>
        <p>This is one of the most misunderstood identities. Romantic and sexual attraction are often conflated, however they are vastly different. Sexual attraction specifically refers to sex, whereas romantic attraction specifically refers to all non-sex related attractions in a relationship. This can include holding hands, kissing, hugging, etc. Some have a repulsion to romantic activities, whereas others are apathetic. It's a very broad spectrum.</p>
        <p>Aromantic people are often viewed as "heartless", "confused", or "sex obsessed", which results in indirect (and sometimes direct) discrimination.</p>
    </div>
    <div id = "aroace">
        <h1>Aroace</h1>
        <p>Someone who is both aromantic and asexual, often to varying degrees.</p>
        <p>Aroace people may seek out intimate platonic relationships, known as queer-platonic relationships, in place of sexual/romantic ones.</p>
        <p>Aroace people are often seen as "unnatural" and "heartless", which results in indirect (and sometimes direct) discrimination.</p>
